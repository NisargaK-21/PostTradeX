This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

📈 Transparent Equity Settlement Tracker
Blockchain-based Post-Trade Settlement Transparency System
📌 Project Overview

In traditional equity markets, trades are executed instantly, but settlement and ownership transfer occur later through multiple intermediaries (T+1 / T+2). This delay creates limited visibility into settlement status, increases operational risk, and makes auditing complex for investors and regulators.

This project aims to build a transparent and tamper-proof system that improves visibility into post-trade equity settlement using blockchain, supported by backend services, frontend dashboards, and AI-based analytics.

🎯 Problem Statement

Equity settlement processes are slow, opaque, and fragmented. Investors, brokers, and regulators cannot track settlement progress and ownership transfer in real time. Existing systems rely on isolated databases and intermediaries, which increases settlement risk, disputes, and operational overhead.

💡 Solution Approach

The project will be developed as a modular system consisting of:

Blockchain for immutable settlement records

Backend services for data aggregation and access

Frontend dashboards for visualization and user interaction

AI / ML analytics to identify abnormal settlement delays and patterns

Each module will be implemented independently.

📁 Project Structure (Initial Setup)

This repository currently contains only the base folder structure to support parallel development.
